sitrep:
we are missing the following:
1. adding a function so the user can see their favorite foods
2. add a picture of the food on card
3. I am not sure if the speech-to-text is working (check if it works and if it doesn't fix it)
  
5. use another API we can give the food to and it can give us the nutritional information of that food and add the nutrition to the card
