sitrep:
we are missing the following:

1. add a picture of the food on the card
2. I am not sure if the speech-to-text is working (check if it works and if it doesn't fix it also find out if there is a way to take in all the speech at once and remove the word from the user's speech so we can get all the text at once for example rather than the user having to say the ingredients one by one we can allow the user to say all the foods at once and put them in a list)
3. adding a function so the user can see their favorite foods
  
4. (optional) use another api that can allow the user to take pictures of ingredients they have at home and it adds it to the list
