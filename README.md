* users can send recipes to their friends
* users can add foods to a shopping list
* replaced android logo with app logo
* added functionality where if the user is near a grocery store they get a notification to buy thier groceries from thier shopping list (need to test on phone, also note that the location for the grocery stores are hard coded because there was no API I can use that's free, if you're reading this and don't like the function do rollback to the old commit)
